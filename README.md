# Ransomware-VAPT

Vulnerability assessment tools discover which vulnerabilities are present, but they do not differentiate between flaws that can be exploited to cause damage and those that cannot. Vulnerability scanners alert companies to the preexisting flaws in their code and where they are located. Penetration tests attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities in a system to determine whether unauthorized access or other malicious activity is possible and identify which flaws pose a threat to the application. The system undergoes static code and dynamic code analysis. In static code analysis, the code analyzer generates the abstract syntax tree for the targeted file. Taint execution path tree gets analyzed. In dynamic code analysis, based on the Input Validation and Sanitization attributes generates the model for predicting the vulnerabilities. Finally the ransomware behavior checks the identification of vulnerabilities that causes the malware.
